##  Exercise: Install app

Now we are ready to install our WebApp into our server.
It contains: ASP.NET MVC, EF Code first


1. First build it. Sources are in `WebApplication` folder aside to `vagrantfile`
2. Create deployment package - all parameters on next slides
3. Generate SQL using `Update-Database -Script -SourceMigration:0` and save aside to `vagrantfile`
4. Install SQL database - please use *WebAppDB* as name. SQL Management Studio is installed on VM
5. Install Web App - as *Default web site*

This will be state zero :)

note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
