## Copy-paste method

Let's go to http://localhost:8099/app#/library/steps
Then open as suggested: https://library.octopusdeploy.com and search for `Update-Database`

1. We need to change the last line and remove `connectionString` parameters
2. We need to copy files `packages\EntityFramework.6.1.3\lib\net45` to `EntityFramework.6.1.3\tools`
3. Task specification on next slide


note:
    Put your speaker notes here.
    You can see them pressing 's'.
