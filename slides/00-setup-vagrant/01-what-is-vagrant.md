##  Vagrant

>Why you are talking about vagrant? We should talk about Octopus Deploy!!

Vagrant is an open-source tool which helps you create, configure and provision development environments.
Consider it a wrapper around virtualization software like VMware or VirtualBox and provisioning tools for config management such as Puppet or Chef or even PowerShell :)
